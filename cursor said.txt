The correct approach, which you're implementing through your cleanup, is to:
Remove all hardcoded track references from the code
Use a single, consistent method to access stem files for any track
Handle all tracks generically through the stem-audio endpoint
Keep track and stem data in your database (or JSON files) completely separate from application logic
This way, when you add track #1,000, nothing in your code needs to change - your application will handle it exactly the same way as track #1, using the consistent URL patterns and API endpoints you've established.
