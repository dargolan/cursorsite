## Cleanup Tasks (Non-destructive)
1. Component Organization
   - [ ] Move all audio-related components to `components/audio/`
   - [ ] Move all filter components to `components/filters/`
   - [ ] Move common components (Header, Footer, etc.) to `components/common/`

2. File Naming Standardization
   - [ ] Use PascalCase for all component files
   - [ ] Use kebab-case for non-component files
   - [ ] Use `.tsx` extension for React components
   - [ ] Use `.ts` extension for TypeScript files

3. Remove Temporary Files
   - [ ] Review and remove any `.new` files after confirming they're not needed

4. Documentation
   - [ ] Add README files to major directories explaining their purpose
   - [ ] Document component organization structure

## Note
All changes will be made gradually and carefully to avoid affecting any functionality. Each change will be made in a separate commit for easy rollback if needed.
